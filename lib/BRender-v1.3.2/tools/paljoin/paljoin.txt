;Usage: PalJoin <input-text-file> <output-palette>
;
;This utility is designed to allow you to construct a new palette out of bits
;of existing palettes.
;
;Empty lines in the input file, or lines begining with # or ; will be ignored.
;
;A valid line in the input file will contain the following delimited by space,
;tab or comma:
;        <string> : Palette file name.
;        <number> : Source Index-Base - where to start reading colours from.
;        <number> : Index-Range - number of colours to copy.
;        <number> : Destination Index-Base - where to start writing colours to.
;
;Example:
;std.pal 0 64 192
;
; - Copies first 64 colours from std.pal to last 64 colours of output.
;
;The output file will be written once every line of the input file has been
;processed.
;
; TRY USING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND LINE:
; PALJOIN PALJOIN.TXT OUT.PAL
; OR JUST TYPING PALJOIN FOR A DESCRIPTION
;
; This example is for the merging of palette containing 128 strip colours in its
; lower half with a pallete containing 128 texture colours in its upper half.
; Lines begining with ; or # will be treated as comments. Blank lines will be
; ignored. (Range is a count, starting at a Base value, rather than a maximum.)
